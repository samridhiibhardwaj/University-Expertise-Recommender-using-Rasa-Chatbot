# University Expertise Recommender using Rasa Chatbot

In this project the data of all the professors from the Swansea University Website is scraped and stored in MongoDB. A chatbot is created and trained on the scraped data. The chatbot is able to:
a. Greet you.
b. A user would ask about a topic he might want help with, and relevant
professor with expertise is recommended (not more than 3 at any
time).
c. Recommendation is based on the expertise list in profile or from descriptions etc.
